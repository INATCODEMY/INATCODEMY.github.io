Besides impact craters, its only known geological features are lobed ridges or rupes that were probably produced by a period of contraction early in its history.[81] Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind.[82] Its relatively large iron core and thin mantle have not yet been adequately explained. Hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off by a giant impact, or that it was prevented from fully accreting by the young Sun's energy.</p>"
